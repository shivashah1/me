## Hi, im Shiva.
Im a researcher interested in the effects of online platforms, climate change and natural resource scarcity on global political and economic stability. I have previously worked on various business intelligence and software development roles for maritime logistics and financial services companies and as a research officer at the School of Politics and International Relations. Im going to be starting my Masters' thesis in the coming months, where I'll be writing about the causes and catalysts of global crises. This is an archive of my past and current work.
